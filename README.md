# HyperGame
Truly my most ambitious project of them all, I want to make a complete fighting game mixed with the twin-stick shooter genre.
I have no idea how I can make it as precise as classical fighting games but I plan on implementing comboing, stun, dodge, multiple weapons 
and a game mode where the game follows a rythm dictated by a speeding-up music
(on the beat the game runs faster but between two beats the game is slowed down-
Yes I know Mad Rat Dead already did that but I believe I had the idea before they did-but that doesn't matter because I only did it because 
I saw pLolz' brawhlalla scythe montages where he does exactly that kind of time stretching to sync the hits and that's what gave me the idea)
I believe this technique has the power to "rythmify" any video game and I'd like to create that because I believe it has potential.
