# HyperGame
Truly my most ambitious project of them all, I want to make a complete fighting game mixed with the twin-stick shooter genre.
I have no idea how I can make it as precise as classical fighting games but I plan on implementing comboing, stun, dodge, multiple weapons 
and a game mode where the game follows a rythm dictated by a speeding-up music
